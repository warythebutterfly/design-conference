              She will suggest various helpful tools because constant communication is key.

            <h5>Teaching our CSS to play nice</h5>
            <p>
              Talk abstract: As our websites, applications and teams grow larger and more complicated, so does our CSS. 
              Before we know it, we find ourselves no longer with cute little stylesheets, but sprawling, surly teenaged CSS that doesn&#8217;t always play nice with others. 
              We need to learn how to manage and optimize our CSS no matter how large the project or diverse the team. 
              If we start early, we can use best practices and tools to raise full-grown stylesheets any designer or developer would be happy to work with.
            </p>

            <h5>Async Await in Node.js &#8212; How to Master it?</h5>
            <p>
              Async functions are available natively in Node and are denoted by the async keyword in their declaration.
              They always return a promise, even if you don&#8217;t explicitly write them to do so. 
              Also, the await keyword is only available inside async functions at the moment &#8212; it cannot be used in the global scope.
